# Creating a toy model
Toy models are creating using the ToyModel class, defined like this:  
```
ToyModel*model = new ToyModel(distNorm, power, peakNormRel, distMean, distSigma, resSigma, binningTrue, binningReco);
``` 

### Variable definitions:  
**distNorm:** A normalization factor for the whole distribution  
**power:** The power used for the power law  
**peakNormRel:** A normalization just for the peak. This allows one to define the peak height compared to the power law  
**distMean:** This is the mean of the peak of the distribution  
**distSigma:** This is the width of the peak of the distribution  
**resSigma:** The is the width of the smearing function used to create the reco distribution from the true distribution  
**binningTrue:** A c++ vector containing the bin boundaries of the true distribution  
**binningReco:** A c++ vector containing the bin boundaries of the reco distribution  

To carry out unfolding, you need a true histogram, a reco (or observed) histogram, and a matrix of migrations. To get each of these, use the following functions:  
```
TH1F*histTrue = model->GetTrueHist("trueName");   
TH1F*histReco = model->GetRecoHist("recoName");  
TH2F*histMatrix = model->GetMigrationMatrix("matrixName");
```  

Then if you want to see the normalized matrix of migrations, the response matrix, use this:  
```
model->GetResponseMatrix(histMatrix);
```
The response matrix is not needed for unfolding as it will be calculated automatically by the unfolding functions, but it is useful to have.  

# Unfolding
This package has two methods of unfolding: TUnfold(https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTUnfold.html) and a simple matrix inversion method.  
First, create an Unfold class object:  
```
Unfold*unfold = new Unfold();
```
You need to define a regularization type. At the moment, three types are implemented: NO_REG (no regularization), CONST_REG (user defined value of the regularization parameter. this is currently hard-coded because I never use it, but it should be changed), and VAR_REG_LCURVE (used the L-curve scan method to find the best value of the regularization parameter).  
The regularization is defined like this:
```
Unfold::RegType regType = unfold->NO_REG;
``` 
The `unfold` function returns a `TH1F` histogram. 
```
TH1F*histUnfoldedTUnfold   = unfold->unfoldTUnfold(regType,histReco,histTrue,histMatrix);
TH1F*histUnfoldedInversion = unfold->unfoldInversion(histReco,histTrue,histMatrix);
```
The inversion method requires the observed and true histograms to have the same numbers of bins while the TUnfold method requries that the observed distribution has more bins than the true distribution. Keep this in mind, and either create two sets of distributions or create one for TUnfold and then rebin for use in Inversion.  
To plot the results with the true histogram, observed histogram rebinned to match the true binning, and the unfolded histogram along with a plot of the ratio, unfolded/true:  
```
TCanvas*canvas = unfold->plotUnfolded("canvasName","Unfolded title",histReco,histTrue,histUnfolded);
```
Note: Everything shown here would produce a closure test where the true and observed distributions are filled exactly the same as the migration matrix. This means that unfolding should return an exact result with a flat ratio plot at 1.  
To create a more realistic unfolding model, create new histograms for true and reco and randomly fill them from the true and reco functions. You can retrieve the functions like this:
```
TF1*functionTrue = model->GetTrueFunction();
TF1*functionReco = model->GetRecoFunction();
```
